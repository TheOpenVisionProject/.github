## Hi there 👋

The OpenVision Project is an ambitious roadmap of open-source projects dipping into deep learning, hardware, mobile technology, and more to build next-generation, accessible eye care solutions.

The current state of eye care in the world is broken - doctors, equipment, and awareness are not distributed equally, leading to needless human suffering. Our aim is to develop and open-source technologically innovative and accessible diagnostic solutions to prevent blindness at an impactful scale.

Check out our website (https://openvision.framer.website/) for the up-to-date roadmap of projects.
