## Hi there 👋

The OpenVision Project is an ambitious roadmap of open-source projects dipping into deep learning, hardware, mobile technology, and more to build next-generation, accessible eye care solutions.

The current state of eye care in the world is broken - doctors, equipment, and awareness are not distributed equally, leading to needless human suffering. Our aim is to develop and open-source technologically innovative and accessible diagnostic solutions to prevent blindness at an impactful scale.

Check out our website (https://openvision.framer.website/) for our roadmap of projects!

## Current projects
- DeepRet Model: multi-task glaucoma diagnosis model
- OpthoAssitant: ophthamology fine-tuned LLM for accessible medical information
- DeepRet Imager: low-cost, portable, and intelligent retinal fundus imager (RFI)
- OpenVision App: coming to the android app store!
